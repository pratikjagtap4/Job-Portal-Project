// supabaseClient :-
//              The supabaseClient is a function or module that initializes the Supabase client.
//              The supabaseClient function takes the authentication token(provided by Clerk) as an argument and returns an instance of the Supabase client that is authenticated with this token.
//              This authenticated Supabase client instance is used to interact with the Supabase backend, allowing you to perform operations like querying the database, inserting data, and more, all while ensuring that the operations are performed by an authenticated user.
